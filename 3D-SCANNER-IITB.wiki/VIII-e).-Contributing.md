# What should I know before I get started?
Refer to the [Readme.md](https://github.com/animeshsrivastava24/3D-SCANNER-IITB/blob/master/README.md) and the [Software Version Requirement](https://github.com/animeshsrivastava24/3D-SCANNER-IITB/wiki/II.-Software-Version-Requirement)

# How Can I Contribute?
Firstly you need a local fork of the the project, so go ahead and press the "fork" button in GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account and you'll see a note that it's been forked underneath the project name:
***
yourname/3D-SCANNER-IITB
Now you need a copy locally, so find the "SSH clone URL" in the right hand column and use that to clone locally using a terminal:
***
$ git clone git@github.com:yourname/3D-SCANNER-IITB.git
***
Change into the new project's directory:

$ cd 3D-SCANNER

Finally, in this stage, you need to set up a new remote that points to the original project so that you can grab any changes and bring them into your local copy. Firstly clock on the link to the original repository â€“ it's labeled "Forked from" at the top of the GitHub page. This takes you back to the projects main GitHub page, so you can find the "SSH clone URL" and use it to create the new remote, which we'll call upstream.

$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:.../3D-SCANNER-IITB.git
You now have two remotes for this project on disk:

    origin which points to your GitHub fork of the project. You can read and write to this remote.
    upstream which points to the main project's GitHub repository. You can only read from this remote.
### Branch!

The number one rule is to put each piece of work on its own branch. If the project is using git-flow, then it will have both a master and a develop branch.

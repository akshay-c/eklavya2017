# ABOUT:
This a project of FOSSEE, IIT Bombay funded by MHRD, GoI under the guidance of Prof.D B Phatak(Patron), Mr.Rajesh Kushalkar(Project Manager, IDL, IIT Bombay) and Mr. Akshay Chipkar(Project Mentor).
The project aims at developing open source hardware and software for 3D scanning of objects.
The code for this project were written and tested on Ubuntu 14.04.5 with python as the primary programming language.

# DESCRIPTION:
The project was undertaken by four interns during the Summer of 2017 under the Ekalavya Summer Internship sponsored by the MHRD,India at Integrated Development Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay.

  ### 2.4 Numpy 
      NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.

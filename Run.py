#The necessary packages are imported
import Main #local package
import threading #local package

th1=threading.Thread(target=Main.Main()) #Main() defined inside Main.py is called inside a thread
th1.start() #The thread is started

'''PS:
The Developers have used threading to start processes from the very beginning of the program.
This was done to enable execution of any other process parallely with the main process during any point of the runtime.'''
